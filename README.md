# Guessing Game
This is a simple guessing game in JavaScript, where the player tries to guess a secret number generated by the computer. The code is iterative and engaging, providing a dynamic gaming experience.

## Features
### Secret Number Generation
```
var secretNumber = parseInt(Math.random() * 100);
```
The secret number is generated randomly between 0 and 99, using the Math.random() function to create a decimal number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). We multiply this value by 100 and convert it to an integer using parseInt, resulting in a secret number within the desired range.

## Guessing Loop
```
while(guess != secretNumber){
  // Prompt for player's guess
  var guess = prompt('Enter a number between 0 and 100')

  // Check if the guess is equal, greater, or less than the secret number
  if(guess == secretNumber){
    alert('You got it!');
  } else if(guess > secretNumber){
    alert('Wrong... the secret number is smaller');
  } else if(guess < secretNumber){
    alert('Wrong... the secret number is larger');
  }
}
```
The while loop continues to execute until the player guesses the secret number. Within the loop, the player is prompted to make a guess, and the code checks if the guess is equal to, greater than, or less than the secret number, providing hints to guide the player.

## Usage
Execute the code in an environment that supports JavaScript.
A prompt will ask you to enter a number between 0 and 100.
Keep making guesses until you guess the secret number.
Enjoy playing and sharpening your guessing skills!
